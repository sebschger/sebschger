## Hello, I’m Sebastian 🙋🏻‍♂️

I'm putting out feelers in the direction of data science. I have a penchant for wanting to understand things very precisely and I notice details that no one else notices. I love birds and the Scottish countryside. 🐇🐦‍⬛

- 😌 The best ideas come to you when you just _zone out_. That's why _breaks_ are the real _key to creativity_.
- I have a professional background in many fields like _design_ ✏️, _teaching_ 👨🏻‍🏫, _live streaming sytem design_ 🌍, _audio_ 🔊 and even as a _voice-over-artist_ 🎤!
- My academic title 🎓 is _B.A. Designer_, but I’m so much more!
