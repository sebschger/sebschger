## Hello, I’m Sebastian 🙋🏻‍♂️

I'm putting out feelers in the direction of data science 👨🏻‍💻.

I have a penchant for wanting to understand things very precisely and I notice details that no one else notices 🔎.

I love birds and the Scottish countryside 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🐇🐦‍⬛.

### Facts 

- The best ideas come to me when I just _zone out_ 😌. _Breaks_ are my _key to creativity_. Pomodoro ftw! 🍅⏲️
- I like geo data, because it’s really tangible. 
- My academic title 🎓 is _B.A. Designer_, but I’m so much more!
- I have a professional background in many fields like
  - _design_ ✏️
  - _teaching_ 👨🏻‍🏫
  - _sytem design for live streaming_ 🌍
  - _audio_ 🔊

### Fun fact
I worked as a _voice-over-artist_ for years and still do 🎤! 

That’s how I came to be responsible for audio and live streaming at _storytile GmbH_ 💙
